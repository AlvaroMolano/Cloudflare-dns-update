# Cloudflare dns update
Allows me to update my Cloudflare dns record so that I can have access to my server with a dynamic IP

Since I have a dynmic IP at home, but have setup myself with a little web server I needed a way to have nice domain to access it and not worry about the IP changes. There are many greate options out there such as ddns or noip, but why pay for something or go trough the trouble of confirming your account should you choose the free version when you can try and learn something new and create your own script that would mimic the actions of those clients :)

Also the good thing about this is that you can use it for any of your domains / subdomains hosted trough Clodflare and not having to pick one of those free domains.
